# Data Analysis Code Portfolio

This repository serves as a **code portfolio** showcasing my programming and data analysis skills across a variety of real-world and simulated scenarios.  
The focus of this portofolio is on **clear, reproducible, and well-documented analyses**, rather than on a single project or dataset.

## Purpose

The code in this repository is intended to demonstrate:

- Proficiency in data analysis workflows
- Ability to work with diverse data types
- Clean, readable, and modular coding practices
- Reproducibility and documentation standards
- Thoughtful exploratory and statistical analysis

Each folder represents a **self-contained analysis scenario**, often inspired by practical data science, bioinformatics, or applied research tasks.
